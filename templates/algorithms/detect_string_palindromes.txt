Detect Palindromes

def detect_string_palindrome(chars: str) -> str:
    """
    Accepts a string and returns True if string is a palindrome
    Valid palindromes are spelt the same forwards and backwards, for example:
        - "racecar" reversed racecar so racecar should return:
            "racecar is a valid palindrome"
        - "corgis" is "sigroc" reversed so "corgis" should return:
            "corgis is not a valid palindrome"
    Case, punctuation, and whitespaces should be ignored
