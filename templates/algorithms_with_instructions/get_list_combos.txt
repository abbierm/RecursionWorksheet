Get all k combinations of items in a list

"""
Instructions:
    get_list_combos() accepts the arguments:
        - array: A list of primitive data types (strings, floats, ints) 
        - k: an integer number of items that should be in each combination

    A combination is an unordered collection with non-repeating values of a
    larger collections. Generally when finding the combinations, you are 
    given a k-value telling you how many items will be inside of each 
    combination. 

    Combinations are like a sub-selection of a bigger collection. For example,
    if we wanted to find the different combinations of 4 items inside of the 5
    item list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], we would get:

        [[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 5], [1, 3, 4, 5], [2, 3, 4, 5]]

    
    The results of this problem should be a list of nested lists of all of the
    different combinations for the original array containing k-number of values.
