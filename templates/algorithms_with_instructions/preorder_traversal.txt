Pre-Order Traverse a Binary Tree

"""
Instructions: 
    Given the root node, use a preorder traversal strategy to return a list
    of all the names inside a python dictionary binary tree. The binary tree 
    will be in the following format:
        root = {'name': "A", 'children': [{'name': 'B', 'children': []
        }, {'name': 'C', 'children': []}]}

    If root was passed to preorder_traversal, the expected result would be:
        ['A', 'B', 'C']
