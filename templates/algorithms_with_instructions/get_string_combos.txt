Get all k combinations of a string

"""
Instructions:
    get_string_combos() accepts the arguments:
        - chars: A single string  
        - k: an integer number of items that should be in each combination

    A combination is an unordered collection with non-repeating values of a
    larger collections. Generally when finding the combinations, you are 
    given a k-value telling you how many items will be inside of each 
    combination. 

    Combinations are like a sub-selection of a bigger collection. For example,
    if we wanted to find the different combinations of 4 items inside of the 5
    item string "12345", we would get:

        ["1234", "1235", "1345", "2345"]

    
    The results of this problem should be a list of strings of all of the
    different combinations for the original string (chars).  Each individual
    string should be k-number in length. Assume that the original string (chars)
    has no duplicate values.
