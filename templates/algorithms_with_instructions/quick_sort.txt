Quick Sort

"""
Instructions
    Use the quick sort sorting algorithm to re-arrange the integers from array
    into an array of increasing order. 

    The quick_sort algorithm should sort the list in place meaning it won't 
    return a new list. Instead the original list should be altered inside of 
    the function without creating a new list. 

    Example:
        >>>my_list = [5, 10, 2, 7, 22, 8, 4, 15]
        >>>quick_sort(my_list)
        >>>print(my_list)
        [2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 15, 22]

    You can assume that all tests will be correctly formatted lists containing
    integers. 
    
    You can optionally add your own arguments but you should make sure
    the function won't end with an error if those arguments aren't passed in
    the tests. 

        quick_sort(array, left=None, right=None):
            if left is None:
                # assign left
            ...
