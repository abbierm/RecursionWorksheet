String Permutations No Repeats

"""
Instructions:
    get_string_permutations() should generate a list of all the possible
    permutations of the characters inside of the argument "chars" with the 
    specified length. 
    
    For example get_string_permutations("123") should return:
        ['123', '213', '231', '132', '312', '321']

    You can assume the the chars argument will be a valid string and that none
    of the characters will be repeated. 

    The order of the results does that matter as long as all of the possible
    permutations are inside of the resulting list only once.
