Postorder Tree Traversal

"""
Instructions: 
    Given the root node, use a postorder traversal strategy to return a list
    of all the names inside a python dictionary binary tree. The binary tree 
    will be in the following format:
        root = {'name': "A", 'children': [{'name': 'B', 'children': []
        }, {'name': 'C', 'children': []}]}

    If root was passed to postorder_traversal, the expected result would be:
        ['B', 'C', 'A']
