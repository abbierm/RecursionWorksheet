Binary Search

"""
Instructions: 
    Accepts an "item" integer value and an "array" list of sorted integers and
    returns the index of where the item is inside of the array.  If the item is
    not in the array then binary_search should return None. 

    For example:
        binary_search(6, [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]) = 3
        binary_search(5, [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]) = None

    You can add your own arguments to binary_search but the function will only
    be tested with the arguments item and array.  Therefore you need to
    programatically make sure your  extra arguments don't break the tests.
