Karatsuba Multiplication

"""
Instructions:
    Multiply integers x and y using a lookup table rather than using the *
    multiplication symbol. 

    You obviously can cheat, the tests for this problem are only checking that
    the right answer is given.  That being said, this is a pretty interesting
    use case for recursion (and algebra).  You can learn more about Karatsuba
    multiplication by following the link
    https://inventwithpython.com/recursion/chapter5.html 
    and scrolling down to the subsection aptly named "Karatsuba Multiplication"
