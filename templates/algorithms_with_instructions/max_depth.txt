Max Depth of a Binary Tree

"""
Instructions:
    The function should find the max depth of a binary tree represented as a
    python dictionary. Each "node" will have two keys, name and children.
    The "name" value will store the node's unique one letter name and the 
    "children" value will be represents as a list of up to two addtional nodes.

    Example binary tree:
        
    root_node = {"name": "A", "children": [
                                            {
                                                "name": "B", "children": []
                                            },
                                            {
                                                "name": "C", "children": []
                                            }
                                        ]
                }
