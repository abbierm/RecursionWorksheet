Get all list permutations from items on a list without repeats

"""
Instructions:
    Find all of the different orders the items in 'array' can be arranged. get_list_permutations should return a nested list with each individual inner
    list should have a different ordering of the items inside the original
    array.

    For example:
        get_list_permutations([1, 2, 3]) should return:
            [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 3, 1], [2, 1, 3], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]

    You can assume all of the items in array will be primitive types (ints,
    floats, or strings) and that there will be no duplicates in the array.
